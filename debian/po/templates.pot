"Please note that configuration directory has changed from /etc/nsd3 to /etc/"
"nsd in NSD 4.  The new nsd (>= 4.0.0-1) package will automatically move your "
"configuration file from /etc/nsd3/nsd.conf to /etc/nsd/nsd.conf, but it will "
"not migrate everything under /etc/nsd3, so you need to check and move your "
"configuration snippets and zone files by hand."
