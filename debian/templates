_Description: Configuration directory for NSD changed
 NSD 4 has changed the configuration directory from /etc/nsd3 to
 /etc/nsd.
 .
 The old configuration file (/etc/nsd3/nsd.conf) will be moved to
 /etc/nsd/nsd.conf. However, other configuration files in
 /etc/nsd3 will not be moved, so you need to check
 and move your configuration snippets and zone files yourself.
